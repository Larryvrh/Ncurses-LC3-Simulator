* Make a DUMP\_SIM function
  * For DEBUG purposes
  * Looks like what happened in Assignment 2 of CS 210
* Make a log file to help with the above
  * Output time, current instruction, and any files written
* Make a popup for any sim dumps we make
  * Dismissable with a simple keystroke
  * Will just be a popup window with a border that displays:
    * Dumped contents file
    * Any current needed information (e.g. The current highlighted memory address)
    * Allow the user to dump the contents of the output screen (?)
* Make the UI more scalable
  * For differing terminal sizes
* Output the memory context
  * Make it highlightable
  * Allow the user to move around
