# Ncurses-LC3-Simulator

-- Work in Progress --

An ncurses simulator for the LC-3.

Currently it only supports using .obj files that are created when the actual LC-3 Simulator assembles your program.

Usage:

First run `make`, and then, in the same directory, run the following:

```shell
$ ./LC3Simulator [OPTION] <file>
```
